## Updates and Enhancements

### 1. Introduction of the Skip Intro Feature
I are pleased to announce the addition of the **Skip Intro** feature.  
This functionality allows viewers to bypass opening sequences and proceed directly to the main content.  
The feature is supported for most shows and can be enabled or disabled via the settings menu.

### 2. User Preference Data Transfer Capability
To enhance user convenience, I have implemented a **User Preference Data Transfer** feature.  
This ensures that your watch history, preferences, and settings are seamlessly synchronized across all devices.  
Simply log in to your account to access your personalized experience.
