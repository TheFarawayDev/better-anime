## Upcoming Player Layout Fix

I am excited to announce that a remake for the player layout is on the way! I have been working hard to make it more friendly and less colorful.

## Continue Watching Page

In addition to the player layout fix, I am also introducing a new "Continue Watching" page. This feature will allow you to easily pick up where you left off on your favorite shows and movies. No more searching through your watch history â€“ everything will be conveniently located in one place.

## More Episodes

I am thrilled to bring you more episodes of your favorite series. Stay tuned for new releases and enjoy the latest content I have to offer. Though do remember your feedback is always needed for improvments.

Thank you for your continued support!
